# DataShell. 
The Sole purpose of this respository is to hold and house the data being transmitted across lines. This data is interacted from within a personal project of mine. Feel free to copy any of the code for your own datastores and/or projects.

What you can’t see right now is the vast amount of time and energy that went into this project, and my own learning curve. My sole purpose for building this is for me, but I would really love it if people can use it. Hopefully, people can find it useful.

But what else can I say? This is my side project and there are many variables in the data gathering, collection, and processing. The variables being: Location of the data, how fast they are getting processed, the data quality, and what the best and most accurate algorithms are for each task. These are just some of the issues I will have to address in the future as my data grows.

My hope is that this is something that would help someone else along the way. There are many great projects out there that I am looking forward to checking out and learning about. I hope to be a part of that community.

Let me know if you want me to expand on something. I’ll try to do my best to clear up some things.
